## Sample game

The presenter, Yidi Zhu, a RealityKit engineer, showcases the new features of RealityKit by creating a toy spaceship game in this session. The game is extended in the session <doc:WWDC24-111801-Enhance-your-spatial-computing-app-with-RealityKit-audio> and the [sample code](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-a-spaceship-game) is available online.

## New features not covered in detail

The following new capabilities of RealityKit are just briefly mentioned in this session, the viewer is referred to the documentation:

- Low-level access to meshes and textures via **`LowLevelMesh`** and **`LowLevelTexture`**.
- New animation system capabilities, such as **animation timelines** in Reality Composer Pro.
- **`BillboardComponent`** introduces a privacy-preserving way to make entities always face the user.
- **PixelCast** enables pixel-perfect entity selection through a rendering-based approach.
- **Subdivision surface** enables smooth surfaces rendering without creating a dense mesh.

## Cross-platform capabilities

@Row(numberOfColumns: 5) {
	@Column(size: 3) {
		RealityKit has achieved **feature parity** on all platforms (except tvOS): visionOS, iOS, iPadOS and macOS. But there are differences to consider, when developing a cross-platform app:
		visionOS          | iOS, iPadOS, macOS                          
		----------------- | -------------------------- 
		Spatial UI layout | 2D UI layout  
		ImmersiveSpace    | RealityView
		Hands-based input | Touch-based input
	}
	@Column(size: 2) {
		@Image(source: "WWDC24-10103-APIs")
	}
}
	
To this end, `RealityView` has received some enhancements like **camera mode** and **post processing**.
> Tip: The camera mode can be set to world tracking like this:
> ```swift
> RealityView { content in
> #if os(iOS)
>     content.camera = .worldTracking
> #endif
> }
> ```

## Dynamic lights

RealityKit's three types of lights are now available in visionOS 2.0 (author's comment: Finally! üéâ).

However, only spot and directional lights can cast shadows (author's comment: üò≠).
@Image(source: "WWDC24-10103-Lights")

Here's how to add a spotlight to a spaceship's *Headlight* entity:
```swift
guard let lightEntity = spaceship.findEntity(named: "HeadLight") else { return }
lightEntity.components.set(SpotLightComponent(color: .yellow, intensity: 10000.0, attenuationRadius: 6.0))
lightEntity.components.set(SpotLightComponent.Shadow())
```
> Tip: If you don't want an entity to cast a shadow, use this code: 
> ```swift
> let component = DynamicLightShadowComponent(castsShadow: false)
> entity.components.set(component)
> ```

## Hover effects

`HoverEffectComponent` has two new styles, in addition to the default `spotlight` style:

- **Highlight**: The `highlight` style applies a uniform highlight to the entire mesh. Its tint color and strength can be modified, which is now also possible for the `spotlight` style:
```swift
let highlightStyle = HoverEffectComponent.HighlightHoverEffectStyle(color: .lightYellow, strength: 0.8)
let hoverEffect = HoverEffectComponent(.highlight(highlightStyle))
spaceship.components.set(hoverEffect)
```

- **Shader**: The shader style integrates with a shader graph material created with Reality Composer Pro, using the HoverState node's intensity value:
@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
@Column(size: 2) {
```swift
let hoverEffect = HoverEffectComponent(.shader(.default))
spaceship.components.set(hoverEffect)
```
A more complex example is developed in the session <doc:WWDC24-10104-Build-a-spatial-drawing-app-with-RealityKit>
}

}
}

## Hand tracking

Spatial Tracking API makes custom hand tracking easier, which was previously possibly through ARKit only:
- Use a `SpatialTrackingSession` to get the user's consent for hand tracking.
- Create an `AnchorEntity` for a joint like this:
@Image(source: "WWDC24-10103-HandTracking")
- Here's how to control a spaceship's acceleration via the distance between left thumb and index finger, in a system's update function:
```swift
class HandTrackingSystem: System {
    func update(context: SceneUpdateContext) {
        let indexTipPosition = indexTipEntity.position(relativeTo: nil)
        let thumbTipPosition = thumbTipEntity.position(relativeTo: nil)
        let distance = distance(indexTipPosition, thumbTipPosition)
        let force = spaceship.transform.forward * computeThrottle(with: distance)
        spaceship.addForce(force, relativeTo: nil)
    }
}
```
Another example is developed in the session <doc:WWDC24-10104-Build-a-spatial-drawing-app-with-RealityKit>

## Force effects

There are 4 built-in force effects, that define a volume and continuously apply forces to physics bodies in that volume:
- **Constant radial** applies a constant force towards the center
- **Vortex** applies forces that circulate bodies around the axis
- **Drag** applies a breaking force proportional to the velocity
- **Turbulence** applies random forces
@Image(source: "WWDC24-10103-ForceEffects")

**Custom** force effects can be defined by setting `parameterTypes`, `forceMode`, and an `update` function of a `ForceEffectProtocol`, like this gravity effect:
```swift
struct Gravity: ForceEffectProtocol {
    var parameterTypes: PhysicsBodyParameterTypes { [.position, .distance] }
    var forceMode: ForceMode = .force

    func update(parameters: inout ForceEffectParameters) {
        guard let distances = parameters.distances,
              let positions = parameters.positions else { return }

        for i in 0..<parameters.physicsBodyCount {
            let force = computeForce(distances[i], positions[i])
            parameters.setForce(force, index: i)
        }
    }
}
```
Custom force effects can be activated like this:
```swift
let gravity = ForceEffect(effect: Gravity(),
                          spatialFalloff: SpatialForceFalloff(bounds: .sphere(radius: 8.0)),
                          mask: .asteroids)
planet.components.set(ForceEffectComponent(effects: [gravity]))
```

> To apply an initial velocity to an entity, use `PhysicsMotionComponent` like this:
> ```swift
> let physicsMotion = PhysicsMotionComponent(linearVelocity: initialVelocity)
> asteroid.components.set(physicsMotion)
> ```


## Physics joints

Joints connect two pins of two physics bodies together through constraints regarding translation and/or rotation. Pins define a position and orientation that's relative to the entity. There are 6 types of joints: 

- Fixed: Disallows translation and rotation.
- Spherical: Prevents translation, allows limited Y/Z axis rotation and free rotation around the X-axis.
- Revolute: Prevents translation, allows only rotation around the X-axis.
- Prismatic (also called slide joint): Only allows translation along the X-axis.
- Distance: Allows free movement as long as the distance between the two bodies is within a given range.
- Custom

@Image(source: "WWDC24-10103-Joints")

Here's how to set a custom joint between a spaceship (where the pin is at the position of a *Hook* entity) and its trailer:

```swift
guard let hookEntity = spaceship.findEntity(named: "Hook") else { return }
let hookOffset: SIMD3<Float> = hookEntity.position(relativeTo: spaceship)
let hookPin = spaceship.pins.set(named: "Hook", position: hookOffset)
let trailerPin = trailer.pins.set(named: "Trailer", position: .zero)
var joint = PhysicsCustomJoint(pin0: hookPin, pin1: trailerPin)
joint.angularMotionAroundX = .range(-.pi * 0.05 ... .pi * 0.05)
joint.angularMotionAroundY = .range(-.pi * 0.2 ... .pi * 0.2)
joint.angularMotionAroundZ = .range(-.pi * 0.2 ... .pi * 0.2)
joint.linearMotionAlongX = .fixed
joint.linearMotionAlongY = .fixed
joint.linearMotionAlongZ = .fixed
try joint.addToSimulation()
```

## Portal enhancements

Here's how to let an object smoothly cross a portal's surface:

```swift
portal.components.set(PortalComponent(target: portalWorld, 
				     clippingMode: .plane(.positiveZ), 
				     crossingMode: .plane(.positiveZ)))
spaceship.components.set(PortalCrossingComponent())
```

@Image(source: "WWDC24-10103-PortalCrossing")

Since the lighting conditions inside and outside of the portal may differ, a harsh lighting change might occur. To avoid it, use `EnvironmentLightingConfigurationComponent` like this:
```swift
var lightingConfig = EnvironmentLightingConfigurationComponent()
let distance: Float = computeShipDistanceFromPortal()
lightingConfig.environmentLightingWeight = mapDistanceToWeight(distance)
spaceship.components.set(lightingConfig)
```
